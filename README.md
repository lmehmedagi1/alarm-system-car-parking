This repository represents an **alarm system for parking assistance in 2D space**. It was developed using MPLAB and a custom printed circuit board with a PIC16F1939 microcontroller. Distance measuring is attained by HC-SR04 module while the adequate signalization is provided by Arduino YL-44 active buzzer module and two LED. Realtime calculated distance, if needed, is displayed on a JavaFX app which listens for data on a serial data port (jSerialComm library)
